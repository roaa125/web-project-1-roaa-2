    <h3>What is Islam about?</h3>
    <p>
      Islam is not just a religion! Islam is a major global religion! Islam
      means "surrender" in Arabic, highlighting the faith's core idea that the
      believers (Muslims) should submit to Allah's (God's) will. Muslims believe
      Allah is the sole God, the world's creator, sustainer, and restorer.
