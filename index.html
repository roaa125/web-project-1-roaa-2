          <td>
            Along with the Mesopotamians, the Egyptians were the first people to
            develop their language into a codified form of writing. All early
            forms of writing were pictograms-pictures. All writing systems
            developed in this way but their original forms become lost as the
            pictures are refined into abstract forms. What is interesting about
            the Egyptians is that although their writing changed to the abstract
            form of Hieratic, they deliberately preserved the hieroglyphic
            pictures in their original forms.

            Papyrus sheets are the earliest paper-like material all other
            civilisations used stone, clay tablets, animal hide, wood materials
            or wax as a writing surface. Papyrus was, for over 3000 years, the
            most important writing material in the ancient world. It was
            exported all around the Mediterranean and was widely used in the
            Roman Empire and the Byzantine Empire. Its use continued in Europe
            until the seventh century AD, when an embargo on exporting it forced
            the Europeans to use parchment.

            Before: The solar calendar was devised by the Egyptians through
            recording the yearly reappearance of Sirius (the Dog Star) in the
            eastern sky. It was a fixed point which coincided with the yearly
            flooding of the Nile. Their calendar had 365 days and 12 months,
            with 30 days in each month and an additional five festival days at
            the end of the year. However, they failed to account for the
            additional fraction of a day and their calendar slowly became
            incorrect. Ptolemy III added one day to the 365 days every four
            years.

          <td>
            The Egyptian invented eye makeup as far back as 4000 B.C. They
            combined soot with a lead mineral called galena to create a black
            ointment known as kohl. They also made green eye makeup by combining
            malachite with galena to tint the ointment. Both men and women wore
            eye makeup did believe it could cure eye diseases and keep them from
            falling victim to the evil eye.

            At the 2003 dental conference in Vienna, dentists sampled a
            replication of ancient Egyptian toothpaste. Its ingredients included
            powdered of ox hooves, ashes, burnt eggshells and pumice. Another
            toothpaste recipe and a how-to-brush guide was written on a papyrus
            from the fourth century AD describes how to mix precise amounts of
            rock salt, mint, dried iris flower and grains of pepper to form a
            “powder for white and perfect teeth.”
