        The Egyptian invented eye makeup as far back as 4000 B.C. They combined
        soot with a lead mineral called galena to create a black ointment known
        as kohl. They also made green eye makeup by combining malachite with
        galena to tint the ointment. Both men and women wore eye makeup did
        believe it could cure eye diseases and keep them from falling victim to
        the evil eye.
